# Crypto-project

In this samll project I created a GUI of Cryptocurrencies-Tracker by using Python and Tkinter module.

This is not fully completed. In this I used only 3 cryptos i.e Bitcoin, Etherium, Litecoin. In his GUI when the user clicks any one cypto it displays the live cypto trading value. I made this by learning Basics of Tkinter module but, I am still learning it.
